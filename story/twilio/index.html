    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

      <li>1 cup (2 sticks) butter</li>
      <li>1 cup brown sugar</li>
      <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
      <li>2 eggs</li>
      <li>1 tsp vanilla</li>
      <li>1.5 cups white flour</li>
      <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
      <li> 
        2" piece fresh ginger, grated (optional)
        
        Zest of 1 orange (optional) </li>
      <li>1.5-2 cups chocolate chips</li>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Set oven to 350&deg;F</li>
      <li>Mix sugars and butter together. You want the butter to be soft. I usually take it out of the fridge a few hours before I start making my cookies. You can microwave the butter but it just doesn’t work out as well.</li>
      <li>Add eggs & vanilla, mix</li>
      <li>Mix in flour, salt, & baking soda</li>
      <li>Mix in the oatmeal</li>
      <li>Stir in some semi-sweet chocolate chips I recommend between 1.5 – 2 cups. Mini chocolate chips work well too.</li>
      <li>The finished dough won’t look like your typical non-oatmeal dough since there’s less flour in it. That’s fine and expected.</li>
      <li>I recommend 3 sheets of 12 cookies each, cooked one sheet at a time.</li>
      <li>Depending on your oven and cookie size each batch should take about 10-15 minutes. I average about 12 minutes per cookie sheet.</li>
      <li>Here’s the most important part of this recipe and where I usually lose people. You have to take them out before they look totally done. People who haven’t tried my cookies fight me on this, but trust me, you absolutely need to take them out earlier
        than you would expect. Judging exactly when is a skill but I’d recommend taking them out when you feel they could use another 3-4 minutes.</li>
